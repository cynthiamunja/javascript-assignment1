1. Password Validation:
 
Imagine a program where users create accounts. You want to make sure their passwords are strong and not easily guessed. This function checks if a password follows these guidelines:
 
It cannot be blank (empty).
It cannot contain repeated characters in a row (like "1111" or "aaaaa" or "Jjjj").
Optionally, you can add a list of common words that users shouldn't use as passwords (like "password" or "123456").
 
 
2. Password Generation:
 
This function helps users create secure passwords based on their names. It takes the user's first and last names and combines the first 3 characters of the first name with the last 3 characters of the last name, then adds "@2024" to the end. For example, if the user's name is "John Doe", the generated password would be "JohDoe@2024".
 
3. Sum
Imagine you have a shopping cart with various items. Each item has a price, and you want to know the total cost of everything in the cart.
e.g. item=[{price: 10.99}, {price: 5.99}, {price: 29.99}]
 
4. Capitalize Words
Write a program that accepts a string as input, capitalizes the first letter of each word in the 
string, and then returns the result string.
